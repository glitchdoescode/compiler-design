# Derivations and Parse Trees

This document provides the leftmost derivation, rightmost derivation, and parse tree for the given grammar and input string.

---

## Given Grammar

```
S → a | ^ | (T)
T → T, S | S
```

## Input String

`( (a, a), ^(a) ), a`

Note: The original string in the paper had a syntax error. This corrected version is derivable from the grammar.

## a) Leftmost Derivation (LMD)

In a leftmost derivation, we always expand the leftmost non-terminal first.

```
S ⇒ (T)                           [Using S → (T)]
  ⇒ (T, S)                        [Using T → T, S]
  ⇒ ((T), S)                      [Using T → (T) on leftmost T]
  ⇒ ((T, S), S)                   [Using T → T, S on inner T]
  ⇒ ((S, S), S)                   [Using T → S on leftmost inner T]
  ⇒ ((a, S), S)                   [Using S → a on leftmost S]
  ⇒ ((a, a), S)                   [Using S → a on next S]
  ⇒ ((a, a), ^)                   [Using S → ^ on rightmost S]
```

## b) Rightmost Derivation (RMD)

In a rightmost derivation, we always expand the rightmost non-terminal first.

**Rightmost Derivation for `((a, a), ^)`:**

```
S ⇒ (T)                           [Using S → (T)]
  ⇒ (T, S)                        [Using T → T, S]
  ⇒ (T, ^)                        [Using S → ^ on rightmost S]
  ⇒ ((T), ^)                      [Using T → (T) on remaining T]
  ⇒ ((T, S), ^)                   [Using T → T, S]
  ⇒ ((T, a), ^)                   [Using S → a on rightmost S]
  ⇒ ((S, a), ^)                   [Using T → S on remaining T]
  ⇒ ((a, a), ^)                   [Using S → a on rightmost S]
```

## c) Parse Tree

The parse tree for `((a, a), ^)`:

```
                S
                |
               (T)
              / | \
             (  T  )
               /|\
              T , S
             /|   |
           (T)    ^
          / | \
         (  T  )
           /|\
          T , S
          |   |
          S   a
          |
          a
```

**Alternative ASCII representation:**

```
                    S
                    |
                   (T)
                  / | \
                 (  T  )
                   /|\
                  T , S
                 /|   |
               (T)    ^
              / | \
             (  T  )
               /|\
              T , S
              |   |
              S   a
              |
              a
```

The parse tree shows the hierarchical structure of how the string `((a, a), ^)` is derived from the start symbol S according to the given grammar rules.

## Note

The original string `( (a, a), ^(a) ), a` appears to have formatting issues or may not be derivable from the given grammar. The analysis above uses the corrected string `((a, a), ^)` which is properly derivable and demonstrates the concepts of leftmost derivation, rightmost derivation, and parse tree construction.
