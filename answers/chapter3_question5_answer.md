## Top-Down vs Bottom-Up Parsing

### Top-Down Parsing

**Definition:** Top-down parsing constructs the parse tree from the root (start symbol) down to the leaves (terminals). It starts with the start symbol and tries to derive the input string by applying production rules.

**Characteristics:**
- Starts from the start symbol
- Works towards the input string
- Uses leftmost derivation
- Predicts which production to use based on current input
- Also called **predictive parsing** when done without backtracking

**Working Principle:**
1. Begin with the start symbol
2. For each non-terminal, predict which production rule to apply
3. Expand non-terminals using predicted productions
4. Continue until all symbols are terminals
5. Check if the resulting string matches the input

**Example of Top-Down Parsing:**

Grammar:
```
E → T E'
E' → + T E' | ε
T → F T'
T' → * F T' | ε
F → ( E ) | id
```

Input: `id + id * id`

**Top-Down Parse:**
```
E → T E'
  → F T' E'
  → id T' E'
  → id E'           [T' → ε]
  → id + T E'       [E' → + T E']
  → id + F T' E'
  → id + id T' E'
  → id + id * F T' E'  [T' → * F T']
  → id + id * id T' E'
  → id + id * id E'    [T' → ε]
  → id + id * id       [E' → ε]
```

**Advantages:**
- Natural for recursive descent implementation
- Easy to understand and implement
- Good error recovery and reporting
- Can handle semantic actions during parsing

**Disadvantages:**
- Cannot handle left-recursive grammars
- May require grammar transformation (left factoring)
- Less powerful than bottom-up for some grammars

### Bottom-Up Parsing

**Definition:** Bottom-up parsing constructs the parse tree from the leaves (terminals) up to the root (start symbol). It starts with the input string and tries to reduce it to the start symbol by applying production rules in reverse.

**Characteristics:**
- Starts from the input string
- Works towards the start symbol
- Uses rightmost derivation in reverse
- Recognizes handles (right-hand sides of productions) in the input
- Also called **shift-reduce parsing**

**Working Principle:**
1. Start with the input string
2. Identify handles (substrings that match right-hand sides of productions)
3. Reduce handles to their corresponding left-hand side non-terminals
4. Continue until only the start symbol remains

**Example of Bottom-Up Parsing:**

Same grammar and input: `id + id * id`

**Bottom-Up Parse (Shift-Reduce):**
```
Stack: []           Input: id + id * id
Stack: [id]         Input: + id * id      [Shift]
Stack: [F]          Input: + id * id      [Reduce: F → id]
Stack: [T]          Input: + id * id      [Reduce: T → F T', T' → ε]
Stack: [E]          Input: + id * id      [Reduce: E → T E', but need to continue]
Stack: [T]          Input: + id * id      [Actually: T]
Stack: [T, +]       Input: id * id        [Shift]
Stack: [T, +, id]   Input: * id           [Shift]
Stack: [T, +, F]    Input: * id           [Reduce: F → id]
Stack: [T, +, T]    Input: * id           [Reduce: T → F T', T' → ε, but continue]
Stack: [T, +, F]    Input: * id           [F]
Stack: [T, +, F, *] Input: id             [Shift]
Stack: [T, +, F, *, id] Input: []         [Shift]
Stack: [T, +, F, *, F]  Input: []         [Reduce: F → id]
Stack: [T, +, T]        Input: []         [Reduce: T → F * F, simplified]
Stack: [E]              Input: []         [Reduce: E → T + T, simplified]
```

**Advantages:**
- Can handle a larger class of grammars
- No need to eliminate left recursion
- More powerful than top-down parsing
- Efficient for many practical grammars

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex to understand and implement
- Harder to provide good error messages
- Delayed error detection

## Backtracking vs Non-Backtracking Parsers

### Backtracking Parsers

**Definition:** Backtracking parsers try multiple alternatives when faced with a choice. If one choice leads to failure, the parser backtracks and tries another alternative.

**Characteristics:**
- Explores multiple parse paths
- Undoes choices when they lead to failure
- Guarantees finding a parse if one exists
- Can be exponentially slow in worst case
- Simple to implement but inefficient

**Example of Backtracking Parser:**

Grammar:
```
S → a S b | a b
```

Input: `a a b b`

**Backtracking Process:**
```
Try S → a S b:
  Match 'a', now need to parse 'a b b' with S
  Try S → a S b again:
    Match 'a', now need to parse 'b b' with S
    Try S → a S b: Fails (no 'a' in 'b b')
    Try S → a b: Fails (no 'a' in 'b b')
    BACKTRACK
  Try S → a b:
    Match 'a', match 'b', remaining 'b'
    BACKTRACK (doesn't consume all input)
  BACKTRACK to top level

Try S → a b:
  Match 'a', but remaining is 'a b b', not just 'b'
  FAIL

No successful parse found (this input is not in the language)
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple to implement
- Can handle any context-free grammar
- Guaranteed to find a parse if one exists

**Disadvantages:**
- Exponential time complexity in worst case
- Very slow for practical use
- Inefficient memory usage due to backtracking

### Non-Backtracking Parsers

**Definition:** Non-backtracking parsers make deterministic choices and never reconsider previous decisions. They use lookahead to make the correct choice initially.

**Types:**
1. **LL(k) Parsers** (Top-down, non-backtracking)
2. **LR(k) Parsers** (Bottom-up, non-backtracking)

**Characteristics:**
- Make deterministic choices
- Use lookahead to predict correct production
- Linear time complexity
- No backtracking required
- More efficient but require grammar restrictions

**Example of Non-Backtracking Parser (LL(1)):**

Grammar (LL(1)):
```
E → T E'
E' → + T E' | ε
T → F T'
T' → * F T' | ε
F → ( E ) | id
```

Input: `id + id`

**LL(1) Parsing with Lookahead:**
```
Current: E, Lookahead: id
  Use E → T E' (since FIRST(T) contains id)

Current: T, Lookahead: id
  Use T → F T' (since FIRST(F) contains id)

Current: F, Lookahead: id
  Use F → id (direct match)

Current: T', Lookahead: +
  Use T' → ε (since + is in FOLLOW(T'))

Current: E', Lookahead: +
  Use E' → + T E' (since + is in FIRST(+ T E'))

... and so on
```

**Advantages:**
- Linear time complexity O(n)
- Efficient memory usage
- Predictable performance
- Suitable for practical compiler implementation

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires grammar to be in specific form (LL(k) or LR(k))
- May need grammar transformation
- Cannot handle all context-free grammars
