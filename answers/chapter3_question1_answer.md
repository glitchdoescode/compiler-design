# Context-Free Grammars (CFG) and Closure Properties\n\nThis document defines Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) and discusses the closure properties of Context-Free Languages (CFLs).\n\n---\n\n## What is a Context-Free Grammar (CFG)?\n\nA **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** is a formal grammar used to describe a context-free language. It is a powerful way to define the syntax of programming languages, natural languages (to some extent), and other formal languages where the structure can be described through recursive rules.\n\nA CFG is formally defined as a 4-tuple: **G = (V, T, P, S)**\n\nWhere:\n\n1.  **V (or N):** A finite set of **non-terminal symbols** (also called variables or syntactic categories). These are symbols that can be replaced by sequences of other symbols (terminals or non-terminals) according to the production rules. Non-terminals represent abstract grammatical structures.\n    *   *Example:* `{<Expression>, <Statement>, <Term>, <Factor>}`\n\n2.  **T (or Σ):** A finite set of **terminal symbols** (also called tokens). These are the basic symbols or building blocks of the language defined by the grammar. They cannot be replaced further. In programming languages, terminals are typically keywords, identifiers, constants, operators, and punctuators.\n    *   *Example:* `{id, +, *, (, ), number, if, then}`\n    *   The sets V and T are disjoint (V ∩ T = ∅).\n\n3.  **P:** A finite set of **production rules** (or productions). These rules define how non-terminal symbols can be replaced. Each production is of the form:\n    **A → α**\n    Where:\n    *   **A** is a single non-terminal symbol from V (A ∈ V).\n    *   **→** is a symbol meaning \"can be replaced by\" or \"derives\".\n    *   **α** (alpha) is a string of zero or more symbols, where each symbol is either a terminal or a non-terminal (α ∈ (V ∪ T)\*). If α is an empty string, it is often denoted by **ε** (epsilon) and represents an empty production.\n    *   The term \"context-free\" comes from the fact that the non-terminal A can be replaced by α regardless of the context (i.e., other symbols) in which A appears.\n    *   *Example Productions:*\n        *   `<Expression> → <Expression> + <Term>`\n        *   `<Term> → <Term> * <Factor>`\n        *   `<Factor> → ( <Expression> )`\n        *   `<Factor> → id`\n        *   `<Statement> → if ( <Expression> ) <Statement>`\n\n4.  **S:** A special non-terminal symbol from V (S ∈ V) called the **start symbol** (or sentence symbol). This is the symbol from which all strings in the language are derived. The language generated by the CFG, denoted L(G), consists of all strings of terminal symbols that can be derived from the start symbol S by repeatedly applying production rules.\n    *   *Example:* `S = <Expression>` or `S = <Program>`\n\n**Derivation:**\nA string is in the language L(G) if it can be obtained by starting with S and applying production rules until only terminal symbols remain. This process is called a derivation. If a string of terminals w can be derived from S, we write S ⇒\* w.\n\n**Example CFG for simple arithmetic expressions:**\n*   V = {E, T, F} (Expression, Term, Factor)\n*   T = {id, num, +, \*, (, )} \n*   P:\n    1.  E → E + T\n    2.  E → T\n    3.  T → T \* F\n    4.  T → F\n    5.  F → ( E )\n    6.  F → id\n    7.  F → num\n*   S = E\n\nThis grammar can generate strings like `id + num * id` or `(id + id) * num`.\n\n---\n\n## Closure Properties of Context-Free Languages (CFLs)\n\nClosure properties refer to whether a class of languages remains within that class when certain operations are applied to them. Context-Free Languages (CFLs) are closed under several operations, but not all.\n\n**CFLs are CLOSED under the following operations:**\n\n1.  **Union:** If L₁ and L₂ are CFLs, then their union L₁ ∪ L₂ is also a CFL.\n    *   *Proof idea:* If G₁ = (V₁, T₁, P₁, S₁) generates L₁ and G₂ = (V₂, T₂, P₂, S₂) generates L₂, we can construct a new grammar G = (V₁∪V₂∪{S₀}, T₁∪T₂, P₁∪P₂∪{S₀→S₁|S₂}, S₀) where S₀ is a new start symbol and non-terminal sets are made disjoint if necessary. G generates L₁ ∪ L₂.\n\n2.  **Concatenation (Product):** If L₁ and L₂ are CFLs, then their concatenation L₁L₂ (strings formed by taking a string from L₁ followed by a string from L₂) is also a CFL.\n    *   *Proof idea:* Using G₁ and G₂ as above, create G = (V₁∪V₂∪{S₀}, T₁∪T₂, P₁∪P₂∪{S₀→S₁S₂}, S₀). G generates L₁L₂.\n\n3.  **Kleene Star (Iteration or Kleene Closure):** If L is a CFL, then L\* (the set of strings formed by concatenating zero or more strings from L) is also a CFL.\n    *   *Proof idea:* If G = (V, T, P, S) generates L, create G\' = (V∪{S₀}, T, P∪{S₀→S S₀ | ε}, S₀). G\' generates L\*.\n\n4.  **Positive Closure:** If L is a CFL, then L⁺ (the set of strings formed by concatenating one or more strings from L) is also a CFL. (Since L⁺ = L L\*).\n\n5.  **Homomorphism:** If L is a CFL and h is a homomorphism (a function that maps symbols to strings), then h(L) (the language formed by applying h to each string in L) is also a CFL.\n\n6.  **Inverse Homomorphism:** If L is a CFL and h is a homomorphism, then h⁻¹(L) (the set of strings w such that h(w) is in L) is also a CFL.\n\n7.  **Reversal:** If L is a CFL, then Lᴿ (the language containing the reversals of all strings in L) is also a CFL.\n    *   *Proof idea:* If G = (V, T, P, S) generates L, construct Gᴿ = (V, T, Pᴿ, S) where Pᴿ contains A → αᴿ for every production A → α in P. Gᴿ generates Lᴿ.\n\n**CFLs are NOT CLOSED under the following operations:**\n\n1.  **Intersection:** If L₁ and L₂ are CFLs, their intersection L₁ ∩ L₂ is **not necessarily** a CFL. It can sometimes be a CFL (e.g., if one is regular), but there are examples where the intersection is not context-free.\n    *   *Example:* L₁ = {aⁿbⁿcᵐ | n,m ≥ 0} is a CFL. L₂ = {aᵐbⁿcⁿ | n,m ≥ 0} is a CFL. Their intersection L₁ ∩ L₂ = {aⁿbⁿcⁿ | n ≥ 0} is known not to be a CFL.\n\n2.  **Complementation:** If L is a CFL, its complement L\' (with respect to Σ\*) is **not necessarily** a CFL.\n    *   *Proof idea:* If CFLs were closed under complementation, they would also be closed under intersection because L₁ ∩ L₂ = (L₁\' ∪ L₂\')\' and CFLs are closed under union. Since they are not closed under intersection, they cannot be closed under complementation.\n\n3.  **Difference:** If L₁ and L₂ are CFLs, their difference L₁ - L₂ (or L₁ \\ L₂) is **not necessarily** a CFL. (Since L₁ - L₂ = L₁ ∩ L₂\').\n\nUnderstanding these closure properties is important in formal language theory and has practical implications in compiler design, for example, when combining or transforming language specifications.\n
